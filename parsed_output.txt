[Normal] Notes: On the day of my visit, a parent toured with two-year-old and will enroll.  1 infant mixed with a few toddlers.  There are several AS rooms in the primary building and one space in the second building, the lower level game room beside the gym with two bathrooms currently being used in that space. Many classrooms are not open and the one off of the front lobby needs a tremendous amount of work, particularly because it sits where all who come in can see it.
